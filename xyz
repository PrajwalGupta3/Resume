PROJECTS
Unmanned EV ML,YOLO,Pytorch
– Developed a web app to detect melanoma(Developing models for object detection)
– Utilize YOLO model for the same.
Image-Classification-with-CNN-and-Supervised-Models ML,DL,TL,Supervised learning
– This project demonstrates a hybrid approach to image classification by combining deep learning with traditional machine
learning.
– This separation not only leverages the strengths of both methods but also provides a clear framework for understanding
and modifying each component independently.
OncoNova:Melanoma detection DL,TL,Docker,Azure
– Developed a web app to detect melanoma(skin cancer)
– Model could classify melanoma into malignant and benign.
– Model was deployed on cloud via docker
